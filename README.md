# Alexandria
Alexandria a new simplistic high-level dynamic coding language most similar to Python. It's goal is to bridge coders used to block based coding to more complex languages. 

## About
Alexandria (originally titled Blocks) was created by Fandis on April 12th, 2025. It is a multi-paradigm, object-oriented, multipurpose, easy to learn programming language. This language was influenced by Python and Rust but is similar to easier programming like Scratch when comparing syntax.

## Examples
The following examples will show Alexandria code.

**Hello, World!**

```
ln(greeting) 
 // defines the type of variable. in Alexandria, one **cannot** directly display text, but must use a variable.
  greeting = hello, world!
view(greeting) 
  // the command 'view' is synonymous with Python 'print'
```
*Display*
hello, world!

**Countdown**

```
teger(i)
  i = 5

 until i = -1(
  if i > 0(
    view(i)
      i(-)
  )
 else(
  ln(break)
   break = Blastoff!
   view(break)
 )
)
```

***Notes***
'teger' denotes an integer variable.
i(-) decrements by 1.
