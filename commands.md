# Commands
## Variables and Display
In Alexandria, all variables need to be defined before declaring its value or using it in a project.

`
ln(text)
`
- ln() is used for string variables.
- You can not directly print text in Alexandria, you need a variable first. Then, use view(var) to display the text.

`
teger(int)
`
- teger() is used for numerical variables only.
- You can include a teger variable inside a ln variable (or really any variable) by using curly brackets / braces around the variable name (ex. text = the secret # was {secret}.)

`
arith(sum)
`
- arith() is used for arithmetic and other mathematic operations inside a variable.
- There is no need for curly brackets inside an arith variable. (ex.

`
arith(sum)
 sum = x + y
`
)

`
view(var)
`
- In Alexandria, you can not direectly print text, integers, etc. You must give a variable a value, and then view the variable.

## Conditionals
`
if condition()
`
- Executes if the condition is met.

`
else()
`
- Executes if the condition is **not** met.

`
boolean(name)
`
- Assigns a true or false statement.

## Loops

`
until condition()
`
- Repeats what it inside the parentheses until the condition is met.

`
x(+)
`
- Increases the value of x by 1.

`
x(-)
`
- Decreases the value of x by 1.

# Lists
`
map(name)
